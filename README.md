# Pomodoro Spotify Player

https://github.com/waylonwilliams/spotify_pomodoro/assets/145303505/747db07b-8784-463a-8dbf-0fa1ef539b17

## Motivation

Sometimes I listen to music when I study, sometimes I use the pomodoro technique. I wanted to create an app to combine the two to make my workflow seamless by letting the music dictate the work I should be doing rather than a bothersome alarm.

## Features

* User authentication using Spotify login
* Queues sufficient amount of music for work of break periods
* Pauses music for silent sections if selected
* Simple UI to prevent distractions

## How to use


Clone the repository and run the app locally using the following commands

```
git clone https://github.com/waylonwilliams/ai-database-manager.git
cd ai-database-manager
npm install
npm run dev
```
